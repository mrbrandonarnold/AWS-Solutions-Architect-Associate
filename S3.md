## Object Storage 

Object storage is a data storage architecture that manages data as objects as opposed to other storage architectures.

1. Unlimited Storage.
2. S3 console provides interface for you to upload and access data.

### S3 Object

1. Objects contain your data. They are like files.

#### Object may consist of:
1. Key: the name of the object
2. Value: the data itself made up of a sequence of bytes
3. Version ID: when versioning enabled, the version of object
4. Metadata: additional info attached to the object

> ### S3 Bucket
> - Buckets hold objects. Buckets can also have folders which in turn hold objects. 
> - S3 is a universal namespace so bucket names must be unique (think like having a domain name). 

> ### You can store an individual object from 0 Bytes to 5 Terabytes in size.
